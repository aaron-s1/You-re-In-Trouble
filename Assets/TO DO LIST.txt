REMEMBER: Fast, smooth gameplay. Small levels. 10-30 seconds of gameplay per level.


CORE GAMEPLAY
    ~ LEVEL DESIGN
        - Procedural?
    - Decide on how weapons spawn (and which spawn, and when)
    - Interactable UI Blocks that contain the weapons
    - Fix collision of particles later

    ~ WEAPONS
        - Add more weapons (machine gun?, ...)
        - Adjust how forces apply for each weapon, and how much, and when

    ~ PLAYER
        - Health amounts
        - Seperate more Weapon functionality from Movement

VISUALS
- Make piss particles from Streamer stay active if weapon is changed out
- New player model
- Make piss look way better
- Handle animations (MUCH later)
