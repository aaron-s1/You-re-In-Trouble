CORE GAMEPLAY
    ~ LEVEL DESIGN
        - Procedural?
    - Decide on how weapons spawn (and which spawn, and when)
    - UI Blocks to grab weapons
    - Fix collision of particles later

    ~ WEAPONS
        - Add more weapons
        - Adjust how forces apply for each weapon, and how much, and when

VISUALS
- New player model
- Make piss look way better
- Handle animations (MUCH later)
