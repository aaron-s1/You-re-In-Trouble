REMEMBER: Fast, smooth gameplay. Small levels. 10-30 seconds of gameplay per level.


CORE GAMEPLAY
    ~ LEVEL DESIGN
        - Procedural?
    - Decide on how weapons spawn (and which spawn, and when)
    - Interactable UI Blocks that contain the weapons
    

    ~ WEAPONS        
        - Add pushback (to opposing player) for each Weapon's particles
        - Add more weapons (machine gun?, ...)
        - Clean up Particle -> Particle collisions later
            ... consider using different collider types

    ~ PLAYER
        - Health amounts
        - Seperate more Weapon functionality from Movement

VISUALS
- Make active piss particles from Streamer* stay active if weapon is changed out
    (note from later: Why only streamer? Investigate.)
- New player models
- Make piss look way better
- Handle animations (MUCH later)
